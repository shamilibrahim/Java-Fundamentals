# Java-Fundamentals
## Setting Up Development Environment
### 1. Download [Java SE Development Kit(JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and Install it.
  Reference:
  [Java SE Documentation](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk-8-readme-2095712.html)
### 2. Edit The PATH variable.
  Copy the path of the java.exe/javac.exe located inside bin directory where you installed your JDK.
  ```
  javac -version
  java -version
  ```
  Run the above commands on your command prompt or terminal and if it gives the version as output then you are ready to go on.

### 3. Download and Install any Text Editor.
For beginners I prefer starting with the text editors rather than using the IDEs. It will help you to know how exactly things work behind the scene. Here are some of the most widely used text editors but you can also use one of your choice
1.[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2.[Atom](https://atom.io/)
3.[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
4.[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
